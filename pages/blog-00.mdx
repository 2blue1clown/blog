import Comments from '/src/components/Comments/Comments'

import {Heading,Text} from "@chakra-ui/react"

<Heading>Chakra UI</Heading>

I do not have to do annoying paragraphs for everything.

As we can see this makes a new paragraph.



So markdown is still working a treat :)

<Text bg="gray.50">```What does this look like?```</Text>

hmm it could look better.

<Comments></Comments>
